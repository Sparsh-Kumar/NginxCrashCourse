1. As we have already discussed, how we can make as many servers as we want in nginx.
2. We can redirect the request to a particular endpoint to completely different endpoint.
3. For Example , we may have a server listening on port 8080.
4. Its root directory we have set now is '/home/ubuntu/Desktop', and we have placed an 'index.html' file at this root location.
5. So if somebody navigates to 'http://localhost:8080/', he will be served the content of 'index.html' file placed at root location '/home/ubuntu/Desktop'.
6. Now we made another server, listening on port 8888;
7. If someone navigates to home route '/' we want the traffic to be redirected to 'http://localhost:8080/'
8. The nginx.conf code for this is given below.
9. We made use of 'proxy_pass' directive for traffic redirection.

http {

    server {
        listen 8080;
        root /home/tonystark/Desktop/;
        location /images {
            alias /home/tonystark/Pictures/;
        }
    }


    server {
        listen 8888;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
        }
        location /img {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/images;
        }
    }
    
}

events { }
