1. For using Nginx as a static web server, proxy etc you need to make changes to only "nginx.conf" file.
2. There is no other file that you need to modify.
3. In linux systems, the "nginx.conf" file is located inside "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf".
4. In linux you would use these commands frequently.
    a. sudo systemctl stop nginx. # For stopping the nginx server,
    b. sudo systemctl start nginx. # For starting the nginx server.
    c. sudo systemctl status nginx. # For looking the status of nginx server.
    d. sudo systemctl restart nginx. # For restarting the nginx server.
    e. sudo systemctl reload nginx # For reloading a server without stopping or detaching current nginx connections [preferred way for restarting the nginx server].

5. nginx.conf file for creating a Basic Static Web Server.

    http { # This is known as directive
        server { # This is known as directive
            listen 8080;    #This is known as leaf directive, as it don't have any other directive inside of it.
        }
    }

    events { }

6. You can create as many servers as you want.

    http { # This is known as directive
        server { # This is known as directive
            listen 8080;    #This is known as leaf directive, as it don't have any other directive inside of it.
        }
        server {
            listen 9090;
        }
    }

    events { }

7. Now as you can see from point 5 and point 6, we have not given the server a "root directory" from which it can serve it content. 
8. By default if we don't give any root directory to "server" directive, then it will host a default "index.html" file.
9. But we can give the server a root directory also using the syntax given below.
10. Now create a new Directory on Desktop (say /home/tonystark/Desktop/NginxDefaultData).
11. You can specify the root directory for a server to use in Nginx using this syntax

    http { # This is known as directive                                                                                      
        server { # This is known as directive                                                                            
            root /home/tonystark/Desktop/NginxDefaultData/;                                                          
            listen 8080;    #This is known as leaf directive, as it don't have any other directive inside of it.     
        }                                                                                                                
    }

    events { } 

    a. Now as you can see here , when you navigate to http://localhost:8080.
    b. Then nginx will serve index.html file placed in the directory specified in "root" directive above.
    c. If there is no index.html file then the Nginx server will now display 403 Forbidden Error.
    d. But if there is another file (say sample.txt) in the root directory, then you still can navigate to http://localhost:8080/sample.txt file.
    e. You would be able to see the content of that file successfully or you can also navigate to subfolder of that root directory successfully (if available).

12. You can also change the value of "root" directive based on the path navigated by the user.
    a. For example when user navigates to http://localhost:8080/
    b. Then you set the root folder to be /home/tonystark/Desktop/NginxDefaultData
    c. And there is an index.html at that place, so it would be served.
    d. Now you want if user navigates to http://localhost:8080/images.
    e. Then in that case, the root directory or value of root directive becomes /home/tonystark/Pictures.
    f. If there is an index.html file at that place, then it would get served.
    g. If not then he will get an 403 Forbidden error, but he would still be able to see other files.
    h. for example if there is a file named sampleimage.png, at /home/tonystark/Pictures.
    i. Then user can see that image using the url http://localhost:8080/images/sampleimage.png
    j. you can achieve this using the "nginx.conf" code given below

    http {
        server {
            listen 8080;
            root /home/tonystark/Desktop/NginxDefaultData/;
            location /images {
                alias /home/tonystark/Pictures/; # 'alias' is keyword used to set the root folder value here on hitting http://localhost:8080/images endpoint.
            }
        }
    }

    events { }
