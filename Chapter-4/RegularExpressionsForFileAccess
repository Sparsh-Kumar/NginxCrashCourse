1. We can also use regular expressions to allow or not allow download of any file in any path specified in the server.
2. For example you may have a server on http://localhost:8080.
3. For that server, the initial root directory would be '/home/ubuntu/Desktop/'
4. You have 'index.html' file placed in '/home/ubuntu/Desktop/' directory.
5. So after navigating to 'http://localhost:8080/', you will be displayed the content of the file 'index.html' placed in '/home/ubuntu/Desktop'.
6. Suppose you also have another file at '/home/ubuntu/Desktop' named 'file.png'.
7. You can access this file using url 'http://localhost:8080/file.png'.
8. Now we have to specify another path '/images' to the http server.
9. On navigating to this path, the root directory would be '/home/ubuntu/Pictures'
10. You have another 'index.html' file placed at '/home/ubuntu/Pictures'.
11. So after navigating to 'http://localhost:8080/images/', you will be served the html content of the file placed at '/home/ubuntu/Pictures'.
12. You also have another file named file2.png at '/home/ubuntu/Pictures'.
13. So If a user navigating to 'http://localhost:8080/images/file2.png', then he would be able to see that file or download that file.
14. But you want to disallow viewing or downloading of any file with '.png' extension at this path 'http://localhost:8080/images'.
    which has a root directory of '/home/ubuntu/Pictures'.
15. The 'nginx.conf' file code, for this scenerio is given below.

http {
    server {
        listen 8080;
        root /home/tonystark/Desktop/;
        location /images {
            alias /home/tonystark/Pictures/;
            location ~.png$ { # Here we have used the regular expression to restrict the viewing or download of any file having .png extension.
                return 403;
            }
        }
    }
}
